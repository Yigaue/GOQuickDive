1. ## [Tour Go](https://tour.golang.org/list)
Tour Go offers a quick introduction for begginners to the Go syntax. 
And within the browser you can type your code and run them. This makes
it convenient to play around. If you're a begginner or you want to experiment with Go, [here](https://tour.golang.org/list) is good start.

2. ## Learning.Oreilly 
### [Hands-On Go Programming](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-go-programming/9781789531756/)
This is a fastastic book to dive deep into the go language. You can read the entire book
on your browser. And did I mention it is free?.
This book is different because, it's not theory as usual. It's practice all the way.
If you are the type that loves to learn by reading, then it is a great option.
Meanwhile it's a great start for anyone.

Looking for more ðŸ˜€? Don't worry, I would be updating this list from time to time, as I get more input from senior Goland engineers. You can google around, but as much as possible 
the list will maintain quality materials for begginers you can find around the web, then graduate to more advance materials.
